# 🎨 Glass Card UI — Figma Practice Project

## 📘 Overview

This project showcases a **Glass Card UI** that I designed in **Figma** during my initial learning phase. The purpose was to get comfortable with the Figma interface, learn to use design tools efficiently, and explore **modern UI trends** like **Glassmorphism**.

## 💡 Objective

To familiarize myself with:

* Basic and advanced **Figma tools** (frames, auto-layout, constraints)
* Creating **aesthetic modern UIs** using blur, transparency, and gradients
* Understanding **visual hierarchy**, spacing, and alignment
* Building reusable **components and design systems**
